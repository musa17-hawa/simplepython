def count_characters(string):
    '''
    INPUT: STRING
    OUTPUT: DICT (STRING => INT)

    Return a dictionary which contains a count of the number of times each
    character appears in the string.
    Characters which would have a count of 0 should not need to be included in
    your dictionary.
    '''


def invert_dictionary(d):
    '''
    INPUT: DICT (STRING => INT)
    OUTPUT: DICT (INT => SET OF STRINGS)

    Given a dictionary d, return a new dictionary with d's values as keys and
    the value for a given key being the set of d's keys which have the same
    value.
    e.g. {'a': 2, 'b': 4, 'c': 2} => {2: {'a', 'c'}, 4: {'b'}}

def word_count(filename):

    INPUT: STRING
    OUTPUT: (INT, INT, INT)

    filename refers to a text file.
    Return a tuple containing these stats for the file in this order:
      1. number of lines
      2. number of words (broken by wordshitespace)
      3. number of characters

    INPUT: string
    OUTPUT: list of strings

    Given a sentence, give the most common letter for each word.
    You should lowercase the letters. If there's a tie, include any of them.

    example:
    INPUT: "Welcome to Zipfian Academy!"
    OUTPUT: 'e t i a'

    Hint: use Counter and the string join method
    (It is possible to do this in one line, but you might lose some
    readability)

    1 a
